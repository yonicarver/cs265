===============================================================================
NAME:
	prob1
===============================================================================
PROBLEM:
	Determine the number of directories containing problems. Observe that there
	is only one message per file. What is the total number of messages sent?
	Output 2 columns on a single line, the # of directories, and the total # of
	messages sent.

DESCRIPTION: Find the number of directories containing a problem and find the
		   total number of messages sent
INPUTS: ARCHIVE (location to run this script)
OUTPUTS:	xx yy
		xx: number of directories containing problems
		yy: total number of messages



===============================================================================
NAME:
	prob2
===============================================================================
PROBLEM:
	Determine how many messages are in the longest thread. List all the threads
	that are of that length.

DESCRIPTION: Find the longest thread and list all threads of that length
INPUTS: ARCHIVE (location to run this script)
OUTPUTS:	xx filename
		xx: thread length
		filename: names of files with longest length



===============================================================================
NAME:
	prob3
===============================================================================
PROBLEM:
	Write a script that takes, as command-line arguments, the year, month, and
	day, in that order and returns a list of messages that were sent on that day.

DESCRIPTION: Scrape through email archives and return name of files that were
		   sent on the user-specified date (day/month/year)
INPUTS:	ARCHIVE (location to run this script)
		year month day (order specific)
OUTPUTS:
		list of messages sent on day/year/month (command-line inputs)



===============================================================================
NAME:
	prob4
===============================================================================
PROBLEM:
	In each message, pull out the target hostname (not the full email address)
	from the To: line (be careful about finding quoted To: lines). How many
	distinct hostnames are there? How many messages were sent to each. output
	2 columns, the hostname and # of messages sent there. 1 record per line,
	sorted by column 2, in descending order. The last line shall be "total nnn",
	where nnn is the total # of distinct hostnames.

DESCRIPTION: Find the hostnames (sender's email address) and count how many there
		   are in the ARCHIVE directory. Count total hostnames.
INPUTS: ARCHIVE (location to run this script)
OUTPUTS:	hostname xx
		total yy
		xx: hostname & number of times it appears
		yy: total number of hostnames
