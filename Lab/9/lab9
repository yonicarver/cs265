DEBUGGING, DBG
--------------------------
Q1.1 What happened when you ran bug3? Use ls -ot, see if there are any new files
	in your directory.

	Segmentation fault (core dumped)
	Yes, file: core


Q1.2 In which function did it bomb?

	Bombed in:
	#1  0x00000000004009ad in inTable ()
	#2  0x0000000000400920 in main ()


Q1.3 For each, below, record what the problem was, and how you fixed it.

	bug1.c -
		format '%d' expects argument of type 'int *'

		fix:
			scanf( "%d", &n);

	bug2.c -
		format '%d' expects argument of type 'int'
		format %f' expects argument of type 'double'

		fix:
			print("Pi=%f, n = %d\n", pi, n);

	bug3.c -
		Segmentation fault (core dumped)

		fix:
			add "++ numLines" after "st[ numLines ] = strdup( buff );"

	avg.c -
		format '%d' expects argument of type 'int *'

		fix:
			scanf("%d", &n);

	A program that causes a segmentation fault:
		Program is trying to read/write to/from an illegal memory location

		fix:
			no reference to main()

Q1.4 Why can't the compiler catch this? You can uncover the problem by looking
	at a stack trace from when the program crashed.

	It is not a syntax error, it is a logical error


Q1.5 What happens if you are using qsort to sort integers and accidentally pass
	the string comparison function?

	An error will occur because the function cannot sort chars
