INTERFACES
--------------------------
Q1. Describe what is meant by each of the following:
	i. Hide implementation details
	   Implementation of a program should not affect the user

	ii. Choose a small orthogonal set of primitives
	    Use non-overlapping functions and capabilities that do one thing well

	iii. Don't reach behind the user's back
		The interface should not do anything that the user doesn't know about

	iv. Do the same thing the same way everywhere
	    One should implement the same style/interface/program styles consistently

CSV IMPLEMENTATION
Q2. What are the problems w/the first implementation in C (Labs/Interfaces/csvgetline1.c)?
    Cannot have more than 200 chars in buffer & no more than 20 chars in a field

Q3. What things were improved upon in the first revision in C?
    Clearer variable names, no buffer or field limits

Q4. What problems does the first revision (Labs/Interfaces/csvgetline2.c) still have?
    Can you parse 2 different CSV files at the same time? Explain.
    Empty spaces not handled properly
    Cannot parse 2 CSV files at the same time

Q5. Does the C++ implementation solve these problems? What issues still remain?
    Issue of handling empty fields (although does allow reading input from stdin)

Q6. Does the interface for the C++ implementation adhere to our guidelines for
    a good i/f, from lecture?
    Yes.

Q7. Re-write csvgetline2.c so that you can parse more than one file.
    see csvgetline2.c


MAKEFILES
